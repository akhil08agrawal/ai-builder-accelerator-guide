## Questions / Sections

1. **Traction** — Lead with this. Speedrun wants to see momentum first: metrics, users, revenue, waitlist, grants, community signal. They read traction before they read your idea.

2. **What Are You Building?**
   - **The problem** — What pain exists, who feels it, and why current tools fail
   - **The user** — Specific description of your target user persona
   - **The solution** — How your product works, what the core workflow is
   - **What is built today** — Current state of the product, tech stack, what's live
   - **One-liner** — A single sentence that captures the product
   - **Category** — Where you fit (e.g., Developer Tools, AI Infrastructure, Consumer, etc.)

3. **Why This Matters Now** — Timing argument: what changed recently that makes your product possible or necessary today

4. **Founder Information** — For each founder:
   - LinkedIn, email
   - Education, career history
   - Specific accomplishments and relevant experience
   - How you found this problem
   - How the founding team met and works together

5. **Market**
   - **TAM calculation** — Bottoms-up with clear assumptions
   - **Monetization** — Pricing tiers and logic
   - **Why existing tools fail** — Competitive landscape and your positioning

6. **Why a16z Speedrun** — Specific reasons this program (not just any accelerator) fits your needs. Reference their theses, portfolio, operator network, partner credits.

7. **Equity Structure** — Cap table: who holds what, any advisors, prior investment

8. **Supporting Materials**
   - Product demo video
   - Founder video
   - Website
   - Pitch deck (required)

## Required Materials

- [ ] Pitch deck (10-12 slides)
- [ ] Short video pitch (under 2 minutes; phone quality is fine)

## Notes

- The application leads with **traction**, not the idea. Structure your submission accordingly.
- a16z publishes annual thesis documents (e.g., "Big Ideas for 2026"). Map your product to their published theses explicitly.
- The video pitch can be informal — substance over production quality.
