## Their Philosophy

Speedrun is a16z's founder program — distinct from their main fund. It's designed for early-stage companies that already have traction and need to compress 12 months of progress into 12 weeks. The emphasis is on **execution speed**, not exploration.

a16z publishes annual thesis documents ("Big Ideas for 20XX") that reveal exactly what they're excited about. Speedrun cohorts tend to map closely to these published theses. If your startup doesn't align with at least one of their stated themes, your application is swimming upstream.

## What They Care About Most

1. **Traction first, idea second.** The application literally leads with traction. They want to see users, revenue, waitlist, downloads, grants — real momentum. The "What are you building?" section comes after.

2. **Thesis alignment.** a16z invests thematically. Read their latest "Big Ideas" document and explicitly map your product to one or more of their published theses. Don't make them do the work.

3. **A compelling "Why now?"** They want to fund things that are newly possible, not things that someone could have built 3 years ago.

4. **Founders who ship.** They want evidence that you build fast, talk to users, and iterate. Prior founding experience and a track record of shipping products matters.

## Tips for a Strong Application

- **Lead with your strongest traction metric.** If you have users, revenue, or a growing waitlist, put it on page one.
- **Reference their theses by name.** If their latest Big Ideas mentions "Multiplayer AI" or "AI Agents," and your product fits, say so explicitly.
- **Record the video pitch.** It's under 2 minutes, phone quality is acceptable. Don't overthink production quality — they care about substance and energy.
- **Upload a real pitch deck.** This is required (10-12 slides). Don't skip it.
- **Mention the $5M partner credits.** If compute, cloud, or partner credits would genuinely accelerate your development, explain specifically how.
- **Commit to SF.** State clearly that both founders will relocate for the full 12 weeks. In-person commitment matters.

## Red Flags / What to Avoid

- Applying without meaningful traction (even early traction counts, but zero traction is a hard pass)
- Generic "why a16z" answers that could apply to any fund
- Not reading their published theses before applying
- Skipping the pitch deck or video
- Vague market sizing without bottoms-up calculation
- Claiming you're in a category without acknowledging competitors
