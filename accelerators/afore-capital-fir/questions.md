# Afore Capital Founder-in-Residence — Application Questions

**Program:** $100K–$500K+ SAFE, 8-week SF residency
**Cohort size:** 5–8 teams
**Apply at:** https://afore.vc/residence

## Questions / Sections

1. **Your Life and Background** — Deep personal narratives for each founder. Not a resume. They want your life story: where you grew up, what shaped you, pivotal moments, how you think. This is the longest and most personal section.

2. **Why Do You Want to Start a Startup?** — Your motivation. Not "to make money" or "to change the world" — they want the real, specific reason you can't not do this.

3. **What Ideas Are You Exploring?** — Detailed description of what you're building:
   - The core idea and how it works
   - What's built today
   - Current traction and validation
   - Why you have conviction in this specific problem

4. **Why Afore FIR?** — Specific reasons you want this program:
   - What you'd use from Afore (customer database, small cohort, team's product sense, path to bigger round)
   - Reference their model: "day -1 to conviction," "inventing alongside founders"
   - Show you've researched past cohort outcomes

5. **Availability for San Francisco** — Confirm both founders can relocate for the full 8-week residency. Specify which cohort (Spring/Summer).

6. **Past Experience and Accomplishments** — For each founder:
   - Notable achievements with specifics (numbers, outcomes)
   - Technical accomplishments
   - Shared accomplishments as a team

7. **Equity Structure** — Cap table details

8. **Links** — Product demo, founder video, website, LinkedIn profiles, emails

## Required Materials

- [ ] Product demo video
- [ ] Founder video
- [ ] Website URL
- [ ] LinkedIn profiles for all founders
- [ ] Confirmation of SF availability

## Notes

- The "Your Life and Background" section is the heart of this application. Write it like a personal essay, not a LinkedIn summary.
- Afore also runs **Afore Alpha** — consider applying to both programs simultaneously.
- Small cohort (5-8) means high-touch support but also high selectivity.
- Reference specific Afore team members and portfolio companies to show you've done your homework.
