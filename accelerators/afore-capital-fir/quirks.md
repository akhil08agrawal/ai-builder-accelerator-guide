## Their Philosophy

Afore FIR operates at "day -1 to conviction." They're not looking for companies that already have product-market fit. They're looking for founders who have deep conviction in a problem but haven't yet nailed the product shape. The program is designed to take you from "I know this problem matters" to "I know how to build the right solution."

Their founding partner Anamitra Banerji was the first PM at Twitter. The team's approach is "inventing alongside founders" — they participate in product decisions, not just evaluate from the sidelines.

Their core belief: **"Momentum is the only moat."**

## What They Care About Most

1. **Deep personal narratives.** The "Your Life and Background" section is the heart of the application. They want to understand who you are as a human being, not just as a founder. Write life stories, not professional summaries.

2. **Problem obsession over solution elegance.** They'd rather fund someone who deeply understands a painful problem and is still figuring out the solution than someone with a polished product solving a problem they don't fully understand.

3. **Small-cohort intensity.** With only 5-8 teams per batch, every founder gets significant attention. They're selective because the support is high-touch.

4. **Founder grit and hustle stories.** Afore loves founders who've done uncomfortable things to learn: door-to-door sales, moving cities, bootstrapping from nothing.

## Tips for a Strong Application

- **Write the "Your Life and Background" section like a personal essay.** This isn't your LinkedIn summary. Share formative moments, failures, pivots. Show them the person behind the company.
- **Reference their "day -1 to conviction" language.** Show you understand what stage you're at and why this program fits that stage.
- **Mention their 10,000+ customer database.** If your product needs design partners or early users, explain specifically how you'd use Afore's network.
- **Apply to Afore Alpha simultaneously.** Afore runs a separate pre-seed program (Afore Alpha) alongside FIR. Applying to both increases your surface area.
- **Pursue a warm intro.** Reach out to Afore portfolio founders or Afore Alpha network for a referral.
- **Name the team.** Reference Anamitra, Steeve, or other Afore team members and explain why their specific expertise would help you.

## Red Flags / What to Avoid

- Writing your background section like a resume or LinkedIn bio
- Claiming you've figured everything out (they want founders at the conviction-not-certainty stage)
- Generic "why Afore" answers that could apply to any pre-seed fund
- Not researching past FIR cohort outcomes (Openmart → YC W24 is a notable trajectory)
- Skipping the SF residency commitment (they expect full 8-week in-person)

## What You Get Beyond Capital

- Access to 10,000+ customer database for design partner introductions
- Weekly product demos and lunch sessions with the Afore team
- "Inventing alongside" — direct participation in product decisions
- Optional investor showcase to 200+ VCs at the end of residency
- Continued support past the 8-week program
- Path from FIR to larger round (Afore's network includes major follow-on investors)
