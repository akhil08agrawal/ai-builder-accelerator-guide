## Questions / Sections

1. **Applicant Background** — Primary applicant's education, career, email, LinkedIn. Mention additional team members in comments field.

2. **Technical Expertise** — This is the most technically demanding section of any accelerator application. For each technical team member:
   - Specific systems built, with architectural detail
   - What was hard about each system (not just what it did, but the unsolved problems you faced)
   - How prior technical work connects to what you're building now
   - Full technical stack breakdown
   - **Key:** They want to know you're not "putting lipstick on an API" (Oren Etzioni's phrase). Prove deep technical differentiation.

3. **What Problem Are You Solving?** — The problem framed as a research challenge, not just a user pain point. Reference relevant academic literature if applicable. Validate with user research data.

4. **Proposed Solution** — Detailed technical architecture:
   - How the system works end-to-end
   - What each component does and why it's designed that way
   - Where foundation models fit and where your own systems add value

5. **How You Use Foundation Models and Where You Go Beyond Them** — The defining section. Sub-topics:
   - Multi-model pipelines and routing logic
   - Retrieval-augmented generation approach (if applicable)
   - Personalization / fine-tuning strategy
   - Interactive or execution environments
   - Knowledge representation and output generation
   - **Current limitations** — What your system can't yet do reliably. Honesty here is valued.

6. **Market Opportunity**
   - TAM calculation with clear methodology
   - Beachhead market and why it's the right starting point
   - Expansion path to adjacent verticals
   - Monetization / pricing tiers
   - Competitive positioning table

7. **Team** — For each founder:
   - Technical and professional background
   - How you work together
   - Research alignment (how your work connects to AI2's research tradition)

8. **Why AI2 Incubator** — Specific alignment:
   - How your problem space maps to AI2's research areas
   - Why the 12-month timeline fits your development needs
   - How you'd use the compute pool
   - What you'd gain from the technical network
   - Engagement model (in-person vs. remote, willingness to relocate to Seattle)

9. **Stage** — Current status:
   - Product maturity, users, traction
   - Time spent building
   - Prior fundraising
   - Legal entity status
   - Equity split

10. **Open-Source Contributions** — Any relevant open-source work, grants, or public research

11. **Supporting Materials** — Demo video, founder video, website

## Required Materials

- [ ] Resume/CV for primary applicant
- [ ] Product demo video
- [ ] Founder video (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Website URL

## Notes

- This is the most technically rigorous application of any accelerator. Budget significant time for the "Technical Expertise" and "Foundation Models" sections.
- AI2 is the Allen Institute for AI — they value research depth. Reference their published work (especially Semantic Scholar) if relevant.
- The 7% common stock (same class as founders) is a distinctive deal structure.
- Seattle-based: be prepared to discuss relocation to AI House at Pier 70.
- They explicitly ask about limitations. Don't hide what doesn't work yet.
