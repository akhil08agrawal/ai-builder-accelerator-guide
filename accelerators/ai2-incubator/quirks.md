## Their Philosophy

The AI2 Incubator is part of the Allen Institute for AI, founded by Paul Allen. Their DNA is research-first. They've spent over a decade on NLP, information extraction, semantic understanding, and built Semantic Scholar — one of the most important academic knowledge tools in the world.

They describe themselves as working "alongside founding teams as a founding team member." The 7% common stock (same class as founders) means their incentives are structurally aligned with yours.

Oren Etzioni, founding CEO of AI2, has a famous line: many AI companies are "putting lipstick on an API." The AI2 Incubator exists to find companies that go deeper.

## What They Care About Most

1. **Genuine technical depth.** This is the most technically demanding accelerator application. They want to see that you've built real systems, encountered hard unsolved problems, and understand where the frontier of research is — not just where the frontier of product is.

2. **Not a wrapper.** You must prove your product has defensibility beyond the foundation model layer. What proprietary systems have you built? What compounds with usage? What can't be replicated by adding a feature to ChatGPT?

3. **Honest about limitations.** They explicitly ask what your system can't do yet. Hiding weaknesses is a red flag. They respect founders who know what's hard.

4. **Research-informed building.** They value companies that draw on academic literature, contribute to open source, and treat their product as applied research.

5. **Long-term technical ambition.** The 12-month incubation timeline signals they want companies building something that takes time to get right, not just quick MVPs.

## Tips for a Strong Application

- **Budget serious time for the technical sections.** The "Technical Expertise" and "Foundation Models" sections could easily be 2,000+ words each. This is not a quick form.
- **Show your work.** Don't just say "we built a RAG pipeline." Describe the specific hard problems you encountered, the architectural decisions you made, and what's still unsolved.
- **Reference AI2's research.** If your work connects to Semantic Scholar, their NLP research, or their published papers, say so explicitly.
- **Explain how you'd use the compute pool.** AI2 has a $200M compute pool. Be specific about what compute-bound problems you'd accelerate.
- **Mention open-source contributions.** AI2's open-source ethos (from Allen Institute's research mission) means they value companies that build in public.
- **Be willing to relocate to Seattle.** AI House at Pier 70 is the home base. Being in person matters.

## Red Flags / What to Avoid

- Applying with a product that's primarily prompt engineering or a thin layer on top of an API
- Vague technical descriptions ("we use AI to do X")
- Claiming your product has no limitations
- Not knowing who AI2 is or what Semantic Scholar does
- Treating the 12-month timeline as unnecessarily long (it signals you don't understand the depth of work required)

## What You Get Beyond Capital

- Up to $1M in compute credits (dedicated machines, custom silicon)
- Access to $200M compute pool
- AI2's technical network for sounding-board conversations and research collaboration
- Participation in interview loops for early hires (AI2's technical judgment helps with recruiting)
- 7% common stock alignment (same class as founders — rare among accelerators)
- Up to 12 months of incubation (longest among top programs)
- Seattle AI ecosystem proximity (Microsoft, Amazon AI research talent)
