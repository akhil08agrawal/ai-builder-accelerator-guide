# Greylock Edge — Application Questions

**Program:** Flexible deal structure (SAFE, seed round, or no capital)
**Duration:** Ongoing partnership
**Apply at:** https://greylock.com/edge

## Questions / Sections

1. **The Insight** — Lead with your core thesis. Not "what you're building" but the fundamental insight about the world that makes your company inevitable. This should be a big, defensible idea.

2. **Why You Pass the 80/20 Test** — Prove your product is not a thin wrapper. Demonstrate defensibility beyond the underlying model:
   - What proprietary layers do you own?
   - What compounds with usage?
   - What creates switching costs?
   - Reference Greylock's "New New Moats" framework if applicable

3. **Your Background** — Concise founder bios focused on:
   - Product-founder fit (why YOU are the right person to build this)
   - Prior founding experience
   - Technical credibility
   - How the team came together

4. **The Big Opportunity** — Market vision:
   - Why this is a new market category, not a feature improvement
   - Market sizing
   - Expansion potential across verticals

5. **Current Status** — Where you are today:
   - Product state, users, traction metrics
   - Demo and website links
   - Team composition (full-time status)

6. **Prior Funding** — Funding history:
   - Previous investment (or bootstrapped status)
   - Current financial structure
   - What deal structure you're open to

7. **Why Greylock Edge** — Specific alignment:
   - Reference Greylock's "incubation heritage" (PANW, Abnormal, Neeva)
   - Thesis alignment with their portfolio
   - How their enterprise network would help at the right stage
   - Commitment to in-person (SF) collaboration

8. **Contact** — Email, LinkedIn for all founders

## Notes

- This is one of the most concise applications. Greylock values density over length.
- The "80/20 test" is their way of asking: "If the model gets 80% better, does your product still matter?" Have a clear answer.
- Warm introduction to a partner (e.g., Seth Rosenberg, Christine Kim) is highly recommended.
- Flexible on deal structure — they care more about the relationship than the terms.
- Greylock describes Edge as "incubation heritage, not programming" — they're not an accelerator in the traditional sense.
