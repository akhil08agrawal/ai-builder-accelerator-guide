## Their Philosophy

Greylock calls Edge "incubation heritage, not programming." They've been building companies from inside their offices since before Edge had a formal name. Palo Alto Networks was built from a desk at Greylock. Abnormal Security started on a whiteboard there. Neeva emerged from a venture partnership conversation.

Edge is **not a traditional accelerator**. There's no batch model, no demo day, no 12-week cohort. It's a company-building partnership where Greylock works alongside you as a co-builder, not a program operator.

Their framework for evaluating AI startups is the **"80/20 test"**: if the underlying model gets 80% better, does your product still matter? If your value lives entirely in the prompt layer, the answer is no.

## What They Care About Most

1. **A core insight, not a feature.** They want to hear your thesis about the world first. Not "we're building X," but "we believe Y is true, and that creates an opportunity." The insight should be big enough to build a category around.

2. **Defensibility beyond the model (the 80/20 test).** They need to believe your product survives model improvement. The answer usually involves proprietary data, user-specific knowledge graphs, compounding network effects, or workflow lock-in.

3. **Product-founder fit.** Why are YOU the person to build this? Not just technical competence — they want to see that your life experience and career led you inevitably to this problem.

4. **Enterprise expansion potential.** Greylock's DNA is enterprise software (Workday, Rubrik, Palo Alto Networks). They're drawn to products that start with a wedge user but have a clear path to enterprise adoption.

## Tips for a Strong Application

- **Lead with your insight, not your product.** The first section should be a thesis about the world that makes your company feel inevitable.
- **Explicitly reference the "New New Moats" framework.** Greylock published this framework about AI defensibility. If your product fits it, map your moats to their language.
- **Get a warm introduction.** Greylock is a relationship-driven firm. A warm intro to Seth Rosenberg, Christine Kim, or another relevant partner significantly increases your chances.
- **Keep it concise.** This is one of the shortest applications. Greylock values density and clarity over length.
- **Be flexible on deal structure.** State that you're open to SAFE, priced seed, or even participation without capital. They care more about the relationship.
- **Show enterprise potential.** Even if your current users are individuals or small teams, articulate how this expands to enterprise knowledge teams.

## Red Flags / What to Avoid

- Leading with "we're building a tool that does X" instead of leading with a thesis
- Not having a clear answer to the 80/20 test
- Applying without attempting a warm introduction
- Being rigid about deal terms
- Positioning as "just" a developer tool without enterprise expansion potential
