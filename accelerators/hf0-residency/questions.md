# HF0 Residency — Application Questions

**Program:** ~$1M uncapped SAFE for ~5% equity
**Duration:** 12 weeks, in-person SF
**Apply at:** https://hf0.com/apply

## Questions / Sections

1. **Repeat Founders** — Required. Each founder must demonstrate prior founding experience:
   - What you built previously
   - Specifics: what happened, how you sold, what you shipped
   - This is a hard prerequisite — first-time founders are not eligible

2. **Technical Depth** — Concise proof of technical capability:
   - What systems you've built, when, and what was hard about them
   - Focus on originality: did you build before frameworks existed? Did you solve novel problems?
   - Development tools and workflow

3. **What You're Building** — Product description in 1-2 paragraphs:
   - What it does, who it's for, and why it matters
   - How it works at a high level
   - Show that you use your own product

4. **Traction** — Bullet-point metrics:
   - Users, waitlist, grants, downloads
   - User research and community validation
   - Revenue (if any)

5. **Where You'll Be by End of Batch** — Concrete 12-week goals:
   - User milestones
   - Revenue milestones
   - Product milestones
   - Team milestones

6. **Why HF0** — Why this specific program:
   - Reference the "subtractive" philosophy (removing distractions, not adding programming)
   - Show you understand the residency model (Archbishop's Mansion)
   - Explain why your product would be useful to other founders in the batch

7. **Availability** — Confirm:
   - Both founders full-time
   - Ready to relocate to SF immediately
   - No competing commitments

8. **Links** — Demo, founder video, website, LinkedIn, email

## Required Materials

- [ ] Product demo video
- [ ] Founder video
- [ ] Website URL
- [ ] LinkedIn profiles

## Notes

- **Repeat founders only.** This is strictly enforced. Each founder needs at least one prior company or independently shipped product.
- The shortest, most concise application of any top accelerator. Write tight.
- If shortlisted, expect a **10-minute in-person interview in SF**.
- The residency is at the **Archbishop's Mansion** in SF — you live and work together with the cohort.
- HF0's philosophy is "subtractive": they remove rent, cooking, distractions so you can focus on customers + building + exercise + sleep.
