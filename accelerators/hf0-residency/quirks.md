## Their Philosophy

HF0's philosophy is **subtractive**. Every other accelerator adds things: mentors, workshops, networking events, demo days. HF0 removes things: rent, cooking, logistics, distractions. The idea is that the best founders don't need to be taught how to build. They need a place where nothing stops them from building.

The residency is at the **Archbishop's Mansion** in San Francisco. You live and work there with the cohort. The intended daily loop: talk to customers, build, exercise, sleep. That's it.

HF0 is **for repeat founders only.** This is strictly enforced. Each founder must have at least one prior company or independently shipped product.

## What They Care About Most

1. **Repeat founders.** No exceptions. They want founders who've been through the startup process before and know what they're signing up for.

2. **Technical depth with evidence.** Not just "we're technical" but "here's the specific hard thing we built, when no framework existed for it, and here's what was challenging."

3. **Concision.** HF0's application is the shortest among top accelerators. They value founders who communicate efficiently. If you can say it in one paragraph instead of three, do.

4. **Self-sufficiency.** HF0 doesn't provide mentors or programming. They provide environment. You need to already know how to execute.

5. **Clear 12-week goals.** They want to see specific, measurable milestones for what you'll achieve during the batch.

## Tips for a Strong Application

- **Prove you're a repeat founder.** Each founder needs a clear story of a previous company or product they shipped independently. Internships don't count. Side projects that shipped to real users can count.
- **Write tight.** Match the application's concise format. Dense, specific sentences beat long narratives here.
- **Set ambitious but credible batch goals.** "Launch publicly and reach 100 WAU" is better than "explore product-market fit."
- **Show you use your own product.** Dogfooding is a strong signal.
- **Explain why your product would be useful to other founders in the batch.** The cohort lives together — if your product serves builders, they're your immediate test market.
- **Confirm immediate SF availability.** They want founders who can relocate without logistical friction.

## Red Flags / What to Avoid

- Applying as a first-time founder (hard disqualifier)
- Long, narrative-heavy answers (this isn't the right application for your life story)
- Vague batch goals ("we'll figure it out during the program")
- Asking what mentorship or workshops are available (there aren't any)
- Not being willing to relocate immediately

## What You Get Beyond Capital

- Archbishop's Mansion residency (housing and workspace)
- All logistics handled (cooking, cleaning, etc.)
- Cohort of 10+ repeat founder teams living and working together
- Zero distractions by design
- ~$1M at uncapped SAFE for only ~5% — one of the best financial terms among accelerators
- 10-minute in-person interview process (fast decision-making)
