## Notes

- PearX asks about how founders **disagree** — have a genuine answer about conflict resolution.
- They will ask "isn't this a wrapper?" — prepare a defensibility answer that goes beyond prompt engineering.
- Referencing Pejman's personal story (arriving in America with $700, building Pear from a rug gallery) resonates if you're a scrappy, under-resourced founder.
- PearX shields companies from investor conversations until after Demo Day — this is a feature, not a limitation.
- The application expects deep user research evidence (80+ interviews, user quotes, specific failure modes).
