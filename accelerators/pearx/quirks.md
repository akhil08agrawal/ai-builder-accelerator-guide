## Their Philosophy

Pear VC's core philosophy is **"fall in love with the problem, not the solution."** They want founders who spent months understanding a painful problem before writing a line of code. User research, interviews, and deep problem immersion are the currency at Pear.

Founded by Pejman Nozad, who arrived in America with $700 and started Pear from a rug gallery on University Avenue in Palo Alto. That origin story shapes Pear's culture: they have a soft spot for scrappy, under-resourced founders who close the gap through hustle rather than pedigree.

PearX is their accelerator program. A defining feature: **they shield companies from investor conversations until after Demo Day** so founders can focus entirely on product and customers during the program.

## What They Care About Most

1. **Problem depth over solution elegance.** They want evidence you've talked to dozens (ideally 50+) of potential users and can articulate the problem in their words, not yours.

2. **Scrappy founders.** They're drawn to founders who've done hard, uncomfortable things to learn: moved cities, sold door-to-door, bootstrapped with no safety net. Hustle stories resonate here.

3. **Not a wrapper.** Mar (partner) will ask the defensibility question. Be prepared to explain why your product isn't a thin layer on ChatGPT. Data moats, personalization layers, proprietary pipelines — have a clear answer.

4. **How the team disagrees.** Unique among accelerators: PearX asks how co-founders handle conflict. They want genuine answers about disagreement and resolution patterns.

5. **User-generated data as a moat.** They've written about backing "vertical AI companies where fine-tuned models on user-generated data create compounding defensibility." If that describes your product, say so.

## Tips for a Strong Application

- **Lead with user research.** Number of interviews, specific quotes, named failure modes. Show you earned your conviction through conversations, not assumptions.
- **Anticipate the "wrapper" question.** Write a "Why This Isn't a Wrapper" section proactively. Explain your defensibility before they ask.
- **Reference Pejman's story.** If you're a scrappy founder without pedigree, your story will resonate with Pear's founding values. Don't be shy about it.
- **Reference specific Pear team members.** Mention Mar, Pejman, or Nate and what specific expertise they bring that you need.
- **Have your pitch deck ready.** It's required for the application.
- **Explain why PearX timing fits.** They want to know this cohort (not just any cohort) is the right moment for your company.
- **Describe how your team disagrees.** Give a real example. "We never disagree" is a red flag.

## Red Flags / What to Avoid

- Applying without significant user research
- Not having an answer for the "wrapper" challenge
- Claiming your team never disagrees
- Not having a pitch deck ready
- Generic "why PearX" that could apply to any accelerator
- Positioning yourself as a Stanford/MIT-pedigree founder without showing scrappiness (Pear values hustle over credentials)

## What You Get Beyond Capital

- Protection from investor distractions until Demo Day
- Mar's product sense and "most important question" approach
- Nate's recruiting support for first hires
- GTM team for first paid conversions
- Camp Pear: cohort relationship building
- Continued support from Pear ecosystem post-program
- Pear's AI thesis alignment and portfolio network
