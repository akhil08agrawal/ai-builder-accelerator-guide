## Their Philosophy

Soma Capital's thesis is **"software automating the world."** They back companies where AI automates complex cognitive work that currently requires hours of human effort.

Their operational model is distinctive: they describe themselves as an **"outsourced Chief of Staff"** for their founders. This isn't mentorship in the traditional sense — it's hands-on operational support including warm introductions, hiring help, and product feedback.

The terms speak for themselves: **$100K on an uncapped SAFE with 0% equity** — the most founder-friendly deal among all major accelerator programs. And they commit and wire same day.

## What They Care About Most

1. **Story and hustle.** Soma's application is story-driven. They want to feel like they know you as a person after reading it. Specific moments of failure, persistence, and grit matter more than credentials.

2. **Speed of execution.** They move fast (commit + wire same day) and want founders who match that tempo. Show evidence of shipping quickly and iterating rapidly.

3. **Clear "why us" with specific asks.** Don't say "we want mentorship." Say "on Day 1, we need introductions to enterprise teams in consulting and finance, feedback on our pricing tiers, and help identifying our first three hires."

4. **YC alignment.** Soma has backed 130+ YC companies. They actively help fellows prepare for YC. If you're planning to apply to YC, mention it.

5. **Founder stories over metrics.** While traction matters, Soma weights the founder narrative heavily. They want to feel the personality, the hustle, the conviction.

## Tips for a Strong Application

- **Write it like a story, not a business plan.** The tone should feel like you're telling a friend about your startup over coffee. Use "I" and "we," share specific moments, be genuine.
- **Have specific Day 1 asks ready.** Show you've thought about exactly how you'd use Soma's network from the first day. Name the types of introductions, the specific feedback you need, the hiring roles you're filling.
- **Reference their portfolio companies.** If they backed companies in adjacent spaces (e.g., Cognition for AI agents), draw parallels to your product.
- **Mention YC plans.** If you're applying to YC, say so explicitly. Soma's YC prep support is a key value prop.
- **Include the "three people you'd recruit" section.** Write genuine personal stories for each person — how you know them, why they're irreplaceable.
- **Match their energy.** The application tone should be high-energy, confident, and direct. No corporate speak.

## Red Flags / What to Avoid

- Writing in formal, corporate language
- Not having specific asks for what you'd use Soma for
- Treating the 0% equity as the main reason you're applying (they want founders who value the relationship, not just the terms)
- Generic "How We Heard About Soma" section (this must be a genuine, personal story)
- Being passive ("we'd love to attend office hours") instead of active ("we'll be the most active founders in this cohort")
