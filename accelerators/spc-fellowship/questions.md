## Notes

- This is the **most introspective application** of any accelerator. It prioritizes self-awareness and intellectual honesty over metrics.
- SPC is at the "-1 to 0" stage — they explicitly want founders who have conviction in a problem space but whose product shape is still evolving.
- **Member referral matters.** If you know an SPC member, mention them.
- They ask about **pivot ideas** — this isn't a trick question. They want to see flexible, curious thinking.
- The "three people you'd recruit" question requires genuine personal stories, not just impressive titles.
- The "riskiest decision" question should reveal real stakes, not just career risk.
- SPC started as a reading group around a dining table. If your journey has a similar origin story of intellectual curiosity, lead with it.
