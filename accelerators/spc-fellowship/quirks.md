## Their Philosophy

SPC started as a **reading group** — people gathering around a dining table to discuss AI papers. That origin defines the culture: intellectual curiosity over pitch-deck polish.

They explicitly operate at the **"-1 to 0" stage**. This means founders who have deep conviction in a problem space but whose product shape is still evolving. SPC is not for companies that already have product-market fit. It's for people who are still figuring out what exactly to build.

Their core question is **"what are you curious about?"** not "what's your ARR?" At SPC, curiosity is the highest-signal input.

## What They Care About Most

1. **Self-awareness and intellectual honesty.** The application is the most introspective of any accelerator. They want to see that you know what you know, what you don't know, and what you're still figuring out. Claiming certainty at the -1 stage is a red flag.

2. **The person, not just the idea.** Their personal questions (most impressive accomplishment, riskiest decision, three people you'd recruit) are designed to understand how you think, how you take risks, and what kind of people you attract.

3. **Member referral.** If an existing SPC member referred you, mention them. Community fit matters, and a vouched-for introduction carries weight.

4. **Flexible, curious thinking.** They ask about pivot ideas — what you'd do if your main idea doesn't work. This isn't a trick question. They want founders who are adaptable and have broad intellectual range.

5. **What you'd bring to the community.** SPC is a community, not just a program. They want to know what perspectives, research, or tools you'd share with other members.

## Tips for a Strong Application

- **Write the personal sections with genuine depth.** "Most impressive accomplishment" should tell a story that reveals character, not just list an achievement. "Riskiest decision" should have real stakes.
- **Be honest about product stage.** "We have conviction in the problem but the product shape is evolving" is exactly the right framing for SPC. Don't pretend to be further along than you are.
- **Have thoughtful pivot ideas.** When they ask "if this doesn't work, what else would you consider?", treat it as a chance to show intellectual range. Give 2-3 genuine alternatives with real reasoning.
- **Mention a member referral if you have one.** An SPC member vouching for you is one of the strongest signals.
- **Write the "three people you'd recruit" as personal stories.** Don't list credentials. Explain how you know each person, a specific moment that showed their quality, and why they'd join you.
- **Reference SPC's origin.** If your own journey started with intellectual curiosity (a reading group, a research obsession, a paper that wouldn't leave your head), draw the parallel to SPC's founding story.
- **Explain what you'd contribute.** Open-source tools, research insights, unique perspectives — show you'd be a net contributor, not just a taker.

## Red Flags / What to Avoid

- Presenting yourself as fully figured out (SPC is for the exploration phase)
- Shallow answers to deeply personal questions
- Not having a member referral (not a dealbreaker, but a disadvantage)
- Treating pivot ideas as a failure to plan (it's a feature of their evaluation)
- Generic "why SPC" that could apply to any accelerator
- Only talking about what you'd get from SPC without mentioning what you'd give

## What You Get Beyond Capital

- Community of intellectually curious builders and researchers
- Environment for rigorous pressure-testing of ideas
- Peer network that understands the -1 to 0 stage
- SPC's reputation and alumni network
- Space to explore and iterate without fundraising pressure
- Reading groups, paper discussions, and intellectual discourse
- Path from fellowship to founding with community support
